# üè† Basic Amazon Homepage Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a static clone of the basic homepage layout of Amazon.com. It's built using only HTML for the page structure and CSS for styling, aiming to replicate the visual appearance of key elements.

**Note:** This project is purely a frontend exercise and does not include any functional backend logic for browsing, searching, or purchasing.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Features

* Replicated the basic layout of the Amazon homepage.
* Styled common elements like the header, navigation bar, product sections, and footer using CSS.
* Demonstrates understanding of HTML structure and CSS layout techniques (e.g., Flexbox, Grid).

## Limitations

* This is a static clone; no dynamic content or user interaction is implemented.
* Search functionality is non-operational.
* "Add to Cart" and other interactive buttons do not have any underlying functionality.
* Responsiveness for different screen sizes might be basic or not fully implemented.

## Further Development (Potential Ideas)

* Implementing responsiveness using media queries.
* Adding basic JavaScript for simple interactive elements.
* Using a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) for faster styling.





# üå¶Ô∏èWeather Application

This is a web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city they search for. It utilizes an external weather API to fetch and display current weather conditions.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 (for structuring the web page)
* CSS3 (for styling and layout)
* JavaScript (for handling user input, API calls, and dynamic updates)

## Features

* User-friendly interface with an input field for city search.
* Fetches and displays current weather information for the searched city.
* Shows temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on the API and implementation).
* Displays humidity percentage.
* Shows wind speed (in km/h or mph).
* Displays a visual representation of the weather condition (e.g., using icons for clouds, rain, sun).
* Handles cases where the city name is invalid or not found (error message).

## API Integration

This application integrates with a weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). You will need to sign up for a free API key to use the application.

**Important:** Ensure your API key is securely handled and not exposed publicly in a production environment.

## Potential Enhancements

* Displaying weather forecast for multiple days.
* Allowing users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
* Showing more detailed weather information (e.g., pressure, visibility).
* Implementing location-based weather retrieval (using geolocation).
* Improving the visual design and user experience.
