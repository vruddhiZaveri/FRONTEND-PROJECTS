# FRONTEND-PROJECTS ‚ú®

## üè† Basic Amazon Homepage Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a static clone of the basic homepage layout of Amazon.com. It's built using only HTML for the page structure and CSS for styling, aiming to replicate the visual appearance of key elements.

**Note:** This project is purely a frontend exercise and does not include any functional backend logic for browsing, searching, or purchasing.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Features

* Replicated the basic layout of the Amazon homepage.
* Styled common elements like the header, navigation bar, product sections, and footer using CSS.
* Demonstrates understanding of HTML structure and CSS layout techniques (e.g., Flexbox, Grid).

## Limitations

* This is a static clone; no dynamic content or user interaction is implemented.
* Search functionality is non-operational.
* "Add to Cart" and other interactive buttons do not have any underlying functionality.
* Responsiveness for different screen sizes might be basic or not fully implemented.

## Further Development (Potential Ideas)

* Implementing responsiveness using media queries.
* Adding basic JavaScript for simple interactive elements.
* Using a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) for faster styling.
