# FRONTEND-PROJECTS ‚ú®

# üè† Basic Amazon Homepage Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a static clone of the basic homepage layout of Amazon.com. It's built using only HTML for the page structure and CSS for styling, aiming to replicate the visual appearance of key elements.

**Note:** This project is purely a frontend exercise and does not include any functional backend logic for browsing, searching, or purchasing.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Features

* Replicated the basic layout of the Amazon homepage.
* Styled common elements like the header, navigation bar, product sections, and footer using CSS.
* Demonstrates understanding of HTML structure and CSS layout techniques (e.g., Flexbox, Grid).

## Limitations

* This is a static clone; no dynamic content or user interaction is implemented.
* Search functionality is non-operational.
* "Add to Cart" and other interactive buttons do not have any underlying functionality.
* Responsiveness for different screen sizes might be basic or not fully implemented.

## Further Development (Potential Ideas)

* Implementing responsiveness using media queries.
* Adding basic JavaScript for simple interactive elements.
* Using a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) for faster styling.

# üå¶Ô∏èWeather Application

This is a web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city they search for. It utilizes an external weather API to fetch and display current weather conditions.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 (for structuring the web page)
* CSS3 (for styling and layout)
* JavaScript (for handling user input, API calls, and dynamic updates)

## Features

* User-friendly interface with an input field for city search.
* Fetches and displays current weather information for the searched city.
* Shows temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on the API and implementation).
* Displays humidity percentage.
* Shows wind speed (in km/h or mph).
* Displays a visual representation of the weather condition (e.g., using icons for clouds, rain, sun).
* Handles cases where the city name is invalid or not found (error message).

## API Integration

This application integrates with a weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). You will need to sign up for a free API key to use the application.

**Important:** Ensure your API key is securely handled and not exposed publicly in a production environment.

## Potential Enhancements

* Displaying weather forecast for multiple days.
* Allowing users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
* Showing more detailed weather information (e.g., pressure, visibility).
* Implementing location-based weather retrieval (using geolocation).
* Improving the visual design and user experience.

# üéØ My Awesome To-Do List App

## Overview

This is a simple and intuitive to-do list application designed to help you stay organized and on top of your tasks. Whether you need to manage daily chores, work projects, or personal goals, this app provides a clean and efficient way to create, track, and complete your to-dos.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your list with a title and optional description.
* **View Tasks:** See all your active tasks clearly displayed.
* **Mark as Complete:** Check off tasks as you finish them, providing a satisfying sense of accomplishment.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.
* **Persistence:** Your to-do list is saved, so you don't lose your tasks when you close the app. (Note: Specific persistence mechanism will depend on the implementation - e.g., local storage, database).


## Technologies Used

* HTML5 (for structuring the web page)
* CSS3 (for styling and layout)
* JavaScript (for handling user input, API calls, and dynamic updates)


## Potential Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future improvements and additions to the app:

* **Edit Tasks:** Allow users to modify the title and description of existing tasks. This would be useful for correcting typos or updating task details. For example, a user might want to change the description of a "Grocery Shopping" task to include specific items.
* **Due Dates and Reminders:** Implement the ability to set due dates for tasks and receive notifications or reminders as the deadline approaches. This would help users stay on schedule and avoid missing important deadlines. For instance, a reminder could be set for a "Pay Bills" task a day before the due date.
* **Task Prioritization:** Enable users to assign priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to their tasks. This would help them focus on the most important items first. High-priority tasks could be displayed in a different color or at the top of the list.
* **Categorization and Tags:** Introduce a system for categorizing tasks (e.g., Personal, Work, Errands) or adding tags (e.g., #urgent, #home). This would allow for better organization and filtering of tasks. A user could then easily view all "Work" related tasks.
* **Search and Filtering:** Add a search bar to quickly find specific tasks by keywords. Implement filtering options based on status (active, completed), priority, due date, or category/tags. This would be invaluable for users with a large number of tasks.
* **Recurring Tasks:** Support the creation of tasks that repeat on a regular basis (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). This would be useful for routine activities like "Water Plants" or "Submit Weekly Report."
* **Subtasks:** Allow users to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This can make complex projects feel less overwhelming. For example, the task "Plan Vacation" could have subtasks like "Research Destinations," "Book Flights," and "Reserve Accommodation."
* **Collaboration (Optional, for multi-user scenarios):** If the app were to support multiple users, features for sharing lists and assigning tasks to others could be implemented.
* **Customization:** Allow users to personalize the appearance of the app with different themes or color schemes.
* **Integration with other services (Optional):** Explore the possibility of integrating with calendar apps or other productivity tools.
